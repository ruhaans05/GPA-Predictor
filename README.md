# GPA-Predictor
Python ML and RStudio statistical tests to find the best predictors to create a student GPA predictor.
I utilized correlation tests and partial/global F-tests in RStudio to analyze variables and which ones would impact the predictor. Then, with Python's sci-kit learn AND Tensorflow libraries, I built models based on transformed datasets to predict a student's GPA based on certain factors.
